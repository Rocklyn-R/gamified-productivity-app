# ✅ Task Master

**Task Master** is a full-stack productivity and gamification app built for portfolio purposes. It allows users to manage their tasks with a fully-featured to-do system — but with a twist: it rewards focus and task completion using a Pomodoro-based gamification system. Users can earn coins by staying productive and redeem them for custom rewards. This project showcases my ability to design and build a complete PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) application with real-world features like authentication, OAuth, CRUD, and time-based mechanics.
